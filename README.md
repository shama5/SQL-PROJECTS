Instagram User Analytics

The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of Instagram user data to derive valuable insights that will assist the product, marketing, and investor teams in making informed
decisions about the future of the platform. Using SQL and MySQL Workbench, the task is to identify key trends, patterns, and areas of improvement for Instagram's user engagement, loyalty,
and marketing efforts.

 I began by importing the provided query to create database and table in MySQL Workbench. This database contained information about users,photos, likes, hashtags, and user interactions.
